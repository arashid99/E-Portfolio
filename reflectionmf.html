							Reflections </br>
At the start of the academic year, I expected statistical analysis to be very difficult </br>
and something which I should not concentrate on as I thought I could avoid it by carrying out </br>
qualitative analysis of data. Moreover, I already had significantly less knowledge and skills of </br>
statistical analysis as I did not learn about it in my prior academic years, compared to my peers </br>
who demonstrated in live seminar sessions that they already have statistical analysis skills. </br>
However, by thinking that something is difficult and trying to avoid doing its not a good approach, </br>
as studies suggest Individuals with a growth mindset realize that their capabilities are not fixed, </br>
even if they feel that they are struggling with specific tasks. They believe that through hard </br>
work, their skills would develop with time (Rhew, et al., 2018).So therefore, by understanding and </br> 
reading essential journals I developed skills and knowledge and I realised that Statistical </br>
analysis using Quantitative data is important too as much as qualitative data analysis for in depth </br> 
and accurate results. To improve my achievement, I perhaps can also try to attend more seminars </br>
which would aid in my knowledge. In the future I can apply these skills to my final research </br>
project and aim to have a growth mindset. Additionally in the Research Methods module there was a </br>
mandatory worksheet for Statistical analysis we had to complete which I was not confident about </br>
having no prior skills as compared to my peers who stated that the worksheets were easy when I </br>
asked them. Studies suggest well-designed worksheets have had positive impacts on students’ </br>
learning achievement (Sasmaz-Oren & Ormanci, 2012). And McDowell and Waddling (1985) proposed that </br> 
worksheets enhancing students' learning of information and skills.Therefore, as a result although I </br>
did find the worksheets challenging, I gained a significant amount of skills in statistical </br>
analysis which I did not have before, but as the module only included two worksheets, to improve my </br> 
skills further I could perhaps attempt more worksheets by independently finding them. In the </br>
future (for the next batch of students) I would probably suggest that the course includes an </br>
increased number of worksheets for students to attempt. As for the research methods process, every </br> 
process holds a significant importance, if one of them is missing then the project will be </br>
unsatisfactory the way I learnt this was by undergoing the research methods module, I gained</br> 
knowledge and was able to identity all processes. But did not quite understand the importance of </br>
making sure each of the process is clearly defined in the project. After submitting my research </br>
proposal presentation for the module my tutor explained in the feedback that I did not clearly </br>
explain the research problem and significance of it but rather briefly included it inside my </br>
literature review section thereafter I realised and learnt that each of the research method </br>
processes need to have a dedicated section that clearly explains the process. Therefore, it’s </br>
important to remember that the importance and the value of what is learnt is far more important </br>
than just memorising, because there is merely no benefit in memorising something if you don’t </br>
understand and are unaware of the reasons of why you have memorised it. Ultimately This skill will </br>
be useful for me throughout my life, academically and in my professional workplace. The impact to </br>
professional and personal experience can be discussed in reference to the Professional skills </br>
matrix and associated Action Plan document which was completed at the start of the course (The </br>
links to the documents are given below). As for communication skills I previously rated my skill </br>
level as trained. I now believe my skill level is proficient/expert I believe I have enough in-</br>
depth knowledge to enable me to express information to both technical and non-technical audiences </br>
by the aid of reports, diagrams, charts etc with little to no supervision required. In the future I </br>
aim to carry on practising my communication skills by conducting the final research project. As </br>
well as professionally applying my skills to the workplace Additionally, I was not confident about </br>
my level of skills regarding policies of IT, and code of conduct at the beginning of the module as </br>
I have never been employed in a professional IT career as compared to my peers where majority of </br>
them are employed in one for several years. So, in a professional workspace when dealing with </br>
personal data every individual is responsible for following the data protection principles (Data </br>
protection, 2022) This is relevant to me as in the future I will be employed in an IT career which </br>
most likely deals with personal data. Therefore I found this aspect very important and paid close </br>
attention to it and after completing several modules of the course I now feel proficient-expert in </br>
policies and code of conduct. As a result, even though adhering to policies and principles can be a </br>
huge responsibility I feel confident enough to be able to apply my knowledge in the workplace in </br>
the future in a professional setting and to improve and keep a reminder of this I can perhaps take </br>
quizzes to test my knowledge.Discussion forums were an aspect of this distance learning course </br>
which was new to me so when I was first introduced to it, I felt and assumed that it was </br>
unnecessary. Studies show it allows for peers and tutors to conveniently interact with each other</br> 
and is the core of online training since learners from various places may easily engage and learn </br>
from one another (Wilson and Fairchild, 2010). Eventually towards the end of the course, I improved </br>
in participating in discussion forums by delivering quality posts and collaborating efficiently </br>
with peers. But in some discussion forums most peers’ responses were very similar to each other</br> 
which I felt like was not effective. This could be because we were given specific bullet points to </br>
mention about in our answer which took away the chance for us to explore wider reading and stuck to </br>
only answering those specific ones. In the future to improve this process possibly there could be </br>
an open opportunity for people to answer and possibly more discussion forums so we have a choice </br>
which one we would like to participate in. I would probably suggest the former suggestion as the </br>
latter one may result in a single student participating in a specific discussion forum whilst the </br>
rest of the peers are participating in others. ReferencesData protection. (2022). Data protection. </br>
